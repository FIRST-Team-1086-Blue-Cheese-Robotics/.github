# _FIRST_ Team 1086 Blue Cheese Robotics

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **_FIRST_Â® Robotics Competition Team 1086 Blue Cheese** from Deep Run High School, Glen Allen, VA! ðŸ§€

## About Us

We are proud to have been a member of the 4-team alliance that won the **2016 FRC World Championship**. Blue Cheese Robotics is a product of **_FIRST_**, a nonprofit organization created to encourage students to explore careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM).

## Our Mission

Our team strives to "brie the best we can brie" by cultivating our own cheese culture in our school, around our community, and spreading it worldwide. We also inspire the next generation of STEM students through:

- **Demonstrations**
- **Outreach Programs**
- **Mentoring Other Teams**

## FIRST Programs

More than 460,000 young people participate in _FIRST_ teams worldwide each year. Learn more about _FIRST_ programs for students in kindergarten through high school on the _FIRST_ Inspires website. It has many valuable resources, including the ongoing longitudinal study by Brandeis University about the value of its programs for young people.

## Year-Round Activities

During the summer and fall, we participate in the National Advocacy Conference, attend two off-season events, staff LEGO robotics camps, teach CAD skills to our students, and do robot demos in our community.
